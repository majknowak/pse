# PSE  
Event-triggered script to notify end users about price changes in electricity in Poland

## How it started?

A friend asked me if it‚Äôs possible to get SMS notifications once the electricity price in Poland goes negative.  
He reached out to me since PSE - Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne (organization responsible for electricity transmission) - publishes this data in a [Power BI Dashboard](https://raporty.pse.pl/?report=SK-D&state=Funkcjonowanie%20RB,Raporty%20dobowe%20z%20funkcjonowania%20RB,Oferty%20bilansuj%C4%85ce,Ilo%C5%9B%C4%87%20energii%20bilansuj%C4%85cej%20i%20niezbilansowania,Podstawowe%20wska%C5%BAniki%20cenowe%20i%20kosztowe&date=2024-10-31&type=table).

Of course, we cannot set up any alerts on a dashboard that‚Äôs not owned by us‚Ä¶  
But it turned out PSE publishes the same kind of information via API üòç

This way, I was able to use my little Python knowledge to come up with a solution that does the job perfectly.

See the full code here: [pse_gh.py](https://github.com/majknowak/pse/blob/9aea94ccb4ff2e777432124e3e5b0ace729997ad/pse_gh.py)

## What's it all about?

### AS IS

The end user is interested in tracking the electricity prices published in the report mentioned earlier:

The thing is, this view reports data in 15-minute intervals, which you probably don't want to check manually so often.

### TO BE

Build an automated solution to check if the current price goes below 0 and, if so, send an SMS. Keep tracking, and do the same if the price becomes greater than 0 again.

Sounds like a perfect real-world implementation for a guy like me üòÉ

Let's get to it!

## Project description

Here's a quick summary of what the code actually does:

### API Request

The code checks the same kind of information as provided in the Power BI Dashboard:

### Process Records

For our use case, it's enough to just check the last two available price records:

- If both of them are negative or both are positive, no action is triggered.
- If there is a move from positive to negative or vice versa, the `send_sms` function is triggered.
- Depending on the price, the SMS body indicates to the end user if it just became positive or negative.

### Logging and Prevention

There are a few more features covering logging and, more importantly, preventing the script from notifying the user about the same price event multiple times:

- A separate `State.json` file stores the last "state," meaning the price record that triggered the notification. It is used for comparison between the currently processed price record, and only if the current one is different from the saved one the new notification triggered. üòä

### Scheduled Execution

The script is stored at [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to enable scheduled execution. This way, I can run it every few minutes to ensure none of the price updates are missed, as they sometimes occur irregularly.

### SMS Notifications

For SMS notifications, I've used [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us). It's easy to set up and not very costly.
